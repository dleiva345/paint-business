# K&L Painting Business Website:

## Overview
Working on creating a business website for my fatherâ€™s company. I found a free website template online and I re-design it to my liking, there is still a couple of adjustments that I would like to make and things that I would like to add to it. As an entry-level Web Developer, I am using this as practice to review the code that was included and become familiar with the technology that was used to create an intuitive and responsive website
